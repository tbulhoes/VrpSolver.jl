1. Throw an error if a model with no graph is defined
2. Retrieve all stats described in the bapcod documentation
3. Reduce the constant from 0.5 to a very small value in the rouding performed by function optimize!
4. Forbid negative coefs in the mapping
5. Investigate why the enumeration needs the parameter RCSPmaxNumOfLabelsInHeurEnumeration when trying 
   to enumerate all paths for building the complete formulation
6. Investigate the use of unbounded unmapped vars
7. The rank-1 cuts are enabled by default. Check if this is a problem when no packing sets are defined
8. Use function get_path_uservar_map in function register_solutions
9. Test the definition of the branching priority in the case of variable with no index
