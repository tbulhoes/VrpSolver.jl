1. Investigate why the enumeration needs the parameter RCSPmaxNumOfLabelsInHeurEnumeration when trying to enumerate all paths for building the complete formulation
2. Perform tests to check the stats retrieved by bapcod. bcRec1stLPDb seems to be wrong
3. Throw an error or a warning when the enumeration should not be used: for instance, when no elem sets are defined or a callback is used
4. Fix and enable the rank-1 cover cuts
