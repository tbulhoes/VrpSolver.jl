1. Reduce the constant from 0.5 to a very small value in the rouding performed by function optimize!
2. Investigate why the enumeration needs the parameter RCSPmaxNumOfLabelsInHeurEnumeration when trying 
   to enumerate all paths for building the complete formulation
3. Investigate the use of unbounded unmapped vars
4. Perform tests to check the stats retrieved by bapcod. bcRec1stLPDb seems to be wrong
5. Throw an error or a warning when the enumeration should not be used: for instance, when no elem sets are defined or a callback is used
6. Check if the following holds about the functions that define initial ng neighborhoods: "This is an explicit way to set initial ng-neighbourhoods, which has priority over the definition with [`define_elementarity_sets_distance_matrix!`].
In fact, distance matrix is taken into account only if user-defined ng-sets are empty."
7. Enable strong k-path cuts
