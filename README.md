# VrpSolver

The VrpSolver.jl package is a Julia interface for [VrpSolver](https://vrpsolver.math.u-bordeaux.fr/). Unlike the
original distribution, this package allows one to run VrpSolver on any major operating system without Docker.

This package is *only for academic use*.

## Requirements

- [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) versions 1.11.5 and higher.
- [CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio) versions 12.9 and higher.
- [BaPCod](https://bapcod.math.u-bordeaux.fr/) shared library (see below how to generate it).


## Adding VrpSolver.jl to your project

To include [`VrpSolver.jl`](https://github.com/tbulhoes/VrpSolver.jl) in your Julia project, follow these steps:

1. **Open your project environment**  
   In the Julia REPL, activate the environment where you are developing:
   ```julia
   ] activate .

2. **Add the package from GitHub**  
   Since `VrpSolver.jl` is not yet registered in the Julia General registry, you need to add it directly from the GitHub repository:
   ```julia
   ] add https://github.com/tbulhoes/VrpSolver.jl

<!-- On Linux, set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable with the absolute path to the subdirectory of your CPLEX
installation which contains the executable files and shared libraries.  For example, if your CPLEX is installed at
`/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio1210` and you are using Bash, you can declare it in the `~/.bashrc`:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio1210/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```


On Windows, be sure that the `PATH` environment variable contains the folder with CPLEX dynamic library. -->

3. **Set the BaPCod shared library**  

    Set the `BAPCOD_RCSP_LIB` environment variable with the absolute path to the BaPCod shared library (which has
    `.so` extension on linux, `.dylib` extension on Mac OS, and `.dll` extension on Windows).
    For example, if you are using Bash on Linux, you can declare it in the `~/.bashrc`:

    ```
    export BAPCOD_RCSP_LIB=/path/to/lib/libbapcod-shared.so
    ```

4. **Optional step**  
    If you want to use the [complete formulation](https://vrpsolver.math.u-bordeaux.fr/doc/methods.html#VrpSolver.get_complete_formulation) (the one that includes mapping constraints with λ variables for paths, and it's very useful for debugging), then you have to configurate a MIP solver via JuMP (e.g. you can install [CPLEX.jl](https://github.com/jump-dev/CPLEX.jl), which requires CPLEX version 12.10 or higher).  

## Producing BaPCod shared library

If the BaPCod shared library you have does not work for you, or you do not have one, you can produce it in the following
way.

Download BaPCod source code on its [web-page](https://bapcod.math.u-bordeaux.fr/). You need an e-mail address from an academic institution for this. Then, install BaPCod using installation instructions in the [BaPCod user guide](https://bapcod.math.u-bordeaux.fr/#userguide).
Read the file `README.md` inside the BaPCod folder, and follow the instructions to produce the BaPCod shared library. The library file is `<path to BaPCod>/build/Bapcod/libbapcod-shared.so` on Linux, `<path to BaPCod>/build/Bapcod/libbapcod-shared.dylib` on Mac OS, and `<path to BaPCod>/build/Bapcod/Release/bapcod-shared.dll` on Windows. Note that the `BAPCOD_RCSP_LIB` environment variable should contain the absolute path to this BaPCod shared library, and not to RCSP library. 

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

On Linux, you may have error:

```
ERROR: LoadError: could not load library "<path to>/libbapcod-shared.so"
<path to Julia>/bin/../lib/julia/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.26' not found (required by "<path to>/libbapcod-shared.so")
```

This is because Julia comes with an older version of the `libstdc++.so.6` library. One solution is build Julia from sources. 
An easier solution is to replace file `<path to Julia>/lib/julia/libstdc++.so.6` with your system `libstdc++.so.6` file. For local machines it is usually located in the folder `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/`. -->
